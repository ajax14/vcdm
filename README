VCDM (aka CDMI-proxy)
---------------------

VCDM is an implementation of CDMI-compatible (v 1.0.1h) server that can be used to store data both using local infrastructure
and public cloud services.

Implementation supports:
- Blobs
- Multi-level containers (also for single-level backends, e.g. AWS or Azure)

MQ support is on the way.

=== SETUP ===
1) Get the contents of the repository.
	- git clone git://github.com/livenson/vcdm.git

2) Get dependencies:
	- install required Python packages (most of them could be installed through easy_install):
		- Zope.Interface: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface
		- Twisted: http://twistedmatrix.com
		- CouchDB-Python: http://code.google.com/p/couchdb-python/			
	- install CouchDB: http://couchdb.apache.org/  (at least version 1)
	
   For MQ support:
	- py-amqplib: http://barryp.org/software/py-amqplib/
	- install RabbitMQ: http://www.rabbitmq.com/	 
		
There are several backends available at the moment. If you are planning to use them, you also need to get the
corresponding libraries (and put them on the PYTHONPATH or into $vcdm/libsrc:
	- AWS: http://code.google.com/p/boto/	
	- CDMI: https://github.com/livenson/libcdmi-python
	- Azure: https://github.com/livenson/winazurestorage
	
3) Copy vcdm.conf.template to vcdm.conf.

4) mkdir data; mkdir data2

4) Run start-server.sh/start-server.bat.
	- by default, ports 2364 and 8080 will be accessible.
	- 2364: debugging access - no encryption or authN
	- 8080: production access - encryption and authN
