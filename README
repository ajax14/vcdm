CDMI-Proxy
----------

CDMI-Proxy is an implementation of a CDMI-compatible (v 1.0.1h) server that can be 
used to store data both using local infrastructure and public cloud services.

Implementation supports:
- Blobs
- Multi-level containers (also for single-level backends, e.g. AWS or Azure)

Authentication is done over HTTP digest. See ''users.db'' for a list of allowed users. 
Default authorization mechanism allows to modify resource subtrees only to their creators.

SETUP
=====
0) Install Python and pip:
	- For Python: CDMI-Proxy _should_ run with python2.6, but 2.7 is strongly 
	  suggested.
	- Pip should be available either from repositories (Linux) or could be installed 
	  following instructions: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html
		For Windows:
			1) Install setuptools: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#files 
			  (choose MSI corresponding to your platform)
			2) easy_install pip

1) Get the code: 
    git clone git://github.com/livenson/vcdm.git

2) Get dependencies:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
    - install CouchDB: http://couchdb.apache.org/  (at least version 1) 
        - Couchbase offers latest versions:  http://www.couchbase.com/downloads/couchbase-single-server/community

There are several backends available at the moment. If you are planning to use them, you also need to get the
corresponding libraries (and put them on the PYTHONPATH or into $vcdm/libsrc:
	- AWS: http://code.google.com/p/boto/	
	- CDMI: https://github.com/livenson/libcdmi-python
	- Azure: https://github.com/livenson/winazurestorage
	
3) Copy vcdm.conf.template to vcdm.conf.

4) mkdir data; mkdir data2 # create two pools for data, check vcdm.conf for more comments

5) Run start-server.sh/start-server.bat.
	- by default, ports 2364 and 8080 will be accessible.
	- 2364: debugging access - no encryption or authN
	- 8080: production access - encryption and authN
